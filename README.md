I'm an enthaustic frontend engineer with over the last 4 years experience, over the years I have designed, developed, and delivered, highly responsive web applications and solutions using modern technologies.  In addition, I have consistently met client expectations and project milestones while collobrating with various cross-funtional teams. Please consider the following highlights:

- Improved the initial load time by 50-65% for the application by reducing the bundle size
- Reduced the static bundle size by 80% resulting in a significant improvement in the load time
- Engineered website builder framework to user build multipage websites just by drag and drop. This is in production use and lets users compose websites in no time.
- Created reusable React UI component library with TypeScript and Storybook used my many internal company projects
- Engineered a framework to dynamically annotate content within the webpages based on web annotation model standard
